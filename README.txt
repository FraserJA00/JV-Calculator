This is a small GUI made for analysing Perovskite (or any) photovoltaics.
It loads a 2 or 4 column file, auto detects the forward/reverse sweep and visualises the data in Matplotlib.
Parameters such as Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE are all calculated and displayed in the notebook.

Built with Python, Tkinter, Pandas and Matplotlib.

This GUI allows users to customise data labels and colours.
This feature can be found in the second tab beside the Parameters column.
Or alternatively pressing the legend & colours button will take you there.

The figure will auto update following changes.

Changes to the legend name must be followed with -> Enter.
This way the input is actually saved.

All axes are customisable using the x and y axis inputs and the Apply axes button.

Figures can be saved in multiple formats for use in presentations or publications!
